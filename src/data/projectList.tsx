        <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500">
          This portfolio is a fully modern, production-grade web application
          built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It&rsquo;s styled using
          Tailwind CSS for utility-first design, and enhanced with smooth,
          responsive animations powered by Framer Motion. Behind the scenes, the
          project is deployed on Vercel with a continuous integration and
          continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, ensuring that every update is
          automatically tested and delivered with speed and reliability. From
          performance optimization to component-based architecture, every detail
          reflects my focus on building scalable, maintainable, and user-centric
          web experiences.

          <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500">
